4. Write a program to add an array of 16-bit numbers and store the 32 bit result in internal RAM.

	AREA  ADDITION , CODE, READONLY

ENTRY	;Mark first instruction to execute

START
	MOV R5,#6	; INTIALISE COUNTER TO 6(i.e. N=6)
	MOV R0,#0	; INTIALISE SUM TO ZERO
 	LDR R1,=VALUE1   	; LOADS THE ADDRESS OF FIRST VALUE
LOOP
	LDR R2,[R1],#2	; WORD ALIGN T0 ARRAY ELEMENT
	LDR R3,MASK	; MASK TO GET 16 BIT
	AND R2,R2,R3	; MASK MSB
	ADD R0,R0,R2	; ADD THE ELEMENTS
	SUBS R5,R5,#1	; DECREMENT COUNTER
	CMP R5,#0	
	BNE LOOP	;  LOOK BACK TILL ARRAY ENDS

 	LDR R4,=RESULT	; LOADS THE ADDRESS OF RESULT 
	STR R0,[R4]	; STORES THE RESULT IN R1

XSS B XSS
	


MASK DCD 0X0000FFFF;  MASK MSB

VALUE1 DCW 	0X1111,0X2222,0X3333,0XAAAA,0XBBBB,0XCCCC	; ARRAY OF 16 BIT NUMBERS(N=6)

	

	AREA DATA2,DATA,READWRITE  ; TO STORE RESULT IN GIVEN ADDRESS			
RESULT DCD 0X0				

	END; Mark end of file

Guidelines to write Output:
1. Write the output of the program which you have executed in the lab.
2. Write the values of all the registers that is used in the program 
i.e in this program write the values of R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and write CPSR
value along with the flag values of CPSR.
3. For this program write the memory window which contains the value.

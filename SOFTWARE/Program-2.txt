2. Write a program to find the sum of the first 10 integer numbers.

	AREA SUM, CODE, READONLY
ENTRY
START
	MOV R5, #10
	MOV R0, #0
	MOV R1, #1
LOOP
	ADD R0, R0, R1
	ADD R1, R1, #1
	SUBS R5, R5, #1
	CMP R5, #0
	BNE LOOP
	LDR R4, =RESULT
	STR R0, [R4]
XSS     B XSS
	AREA DATA2, DATA, READWRITE
RESULT DCD 0X0
	END

Guidelines to write Output:
1. Write the output of the program which you have executed in the lab.
2. Write the values of all the registers that is used in the program 
i.e in this program write the values of R0, R1, R4, R5 and write CPSR
value along with the flag values of CPSR.
3. For this program write the memory window which contains the value.

5. Write a program to find the square of a number (1 to 10) using a look-up table.

	AREA SQUARE, CODE, READONLY
ENTRY                       ;Mark first instruction to execute
START
	LDR R0, =TABLE      ;Load start address of lookup table
	MOV R1, #6	    ;Load the number whose square is to be find
	MOV R1, R1, LSL #0X2;Generate address corresponding to square of given number
	ADD R0, R0, R1      ;Load address of element in lookup table
	LDR R3, [R0]	    ;Get square of given number in R3
	XSS B XSS
;Lookup table contains the Squares of numbers from 0 to 10(in Hex)
	TABLE	DCD 0X00000000 ;Square of 0=0 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000001 ;Square of 1=1 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000004 ;Square of 2=4 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000009 ;Square of 3=9 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000010 ;Square of 4=16 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000019 ;Square of 5=25 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000024 ;Square of 6=36 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000031 ;Square of 7=49 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000040 ;Square of 8=64 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000051 ;Square of 9=81 in decimal
		DCD 0X00000064 ;Square of 10=100 in decimal
	END ;Mark end of file


Guidelines to write Output:
1. Write the output of the program which you have executed in the lab.
2. Write the values of all the registers that is used in the program 
i.e in this program write the values of R0, R1, R3 and write CPSR
value along with the flag values of CPSR.
3. For this program write the memory window which contains the value.
